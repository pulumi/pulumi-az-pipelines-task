# Contributing

We :heart: PRs! If you have something you'd like to contribute, please open an
issue first. We're happy to talk with you about your pull request before you get
started.

For larger features, we'd appreciate it if you open a [new issue](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/issues/new) before investing a lot of time so we can discuss the feature together.
Please also be sure to browse [current issues](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/issues) to make sure your issue is unique, to lighten the triage burden on our maintainers.
Finally, please limit your pull requests to contain only one feature at a time. Separating feature work into individual pull requests helps speed up code review and reduces the barrier to merge.
