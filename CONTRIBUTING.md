# Contributing

We :heart: PRs! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pulumi Open Source community.

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Communications

You are welcome to join the [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/) for questions and a community of like-minded folks.
We discuss features and file bugs on GitHub via [Issues](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-docker-containers/issues). You can read about our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/pulumi/projects/44) on the [Pulumi blog](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/relaunching-pulumis-public-roadmap/).

## Issues

Feel free to pick up any existing issue that looks interesting to you or fix a bug you stumble across while using Pulumi. No matter the size, we welcome all improvements. Our [Help Wanted](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-docker-containers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted)Â label tracks our contribution wishlist, and the [Good First Issue](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-docker-containers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue) label is a great place to start if you're looking to get started.

For larger features, we'd appreciate it if you open a [new issue](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/issues/new) before investing a lot of time so we can discuss the feature together.
Please also be sure to browse [current issues](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/issues) to make sure your issue is unique, to lighten the triage burden on our maintainers.
Finally, please limit your pull requests to contain only one feature at a time. Separating feature work into individual pull requests helps speed up code review and reduces the barrier to merge.

## Submitting a Pull Request

For contributors we use the [standard fork based workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962): Fork this repository, create a topic branch, and when ready, open a pull request from your fork.

## Getting Help

We're sure there are rough edges and we appreciate you helping out. If you want to talk with other folks in the Pulumi community (including members of the Pulumi team) come hang out in the `#contribute` channel on the [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/).
