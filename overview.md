# Pulumi Azure task extension for Azure Pipelines

This extension allows you to run your Pulumi apps in Azure Pipeline as a build and release task.

Here's how a typical Azure Pipelines build configuration file in YAML looks like using the Pulumi task.

Alternatively, you can also use the classic wizard UI to setup a new Azure Pipeline build for your Azure DevOps project. Simply search for the Pulumi task by typing "pulumi" in the list of tasks.

Read on to learn how you can get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an active Azure subscription. Create a new subscription at https://azure.com.
- You must also have an active Azure DevOps account and an organization. Create a new account at https://dev.azure.com.
- Install this extension to your organization. To do this, you must be an admin of the organization.
  - Once installed, you may have to have your admin make the extension available to you or your project.
- Create a [service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops) to your Azure Subscription in your DevOps project.
  - **Note**: At this time, only a `Service Principal Authentication` based service connection can be used with this extension.
  - The name of this service connection is what you will use in the Pulumi task for the input `azureSubscription` if you are using the YAML configuration.

## Quickstart

The goal of the quickstart is to help you setup a "stack" on app.pulumi.com for your account. You can then setup CI in your Azure Pipelines to deploy infrastructure to it.

- If you haven't already signed-up, you may signup for an account at https://app.pulumi.com/signup using your preferred identity. We support GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, and just email/password.
- Once you are logged-in, click on the **New Project** button as shown in the screenshot below, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete setting up a new project.

- Alternatively, you can pick an example from our examples repo at https://github.com/pulumi/examples. Simply click on the **Deploy with Pulumi** button (shown below) to get started.

- Having created the project, you can now use this task extension in your pipeline build to run it in your CI/CD setup. Search for "Pulumi" from the list of built-in tasks when authoring your pipeline build YAML or from the wizard UI.
  - If you cannot find the Pulumi task, contact your organization's administrator to install this extension by clicking the above **Get it free** button.

## Example Pulumi app

Here's an example app that creates an App Service with a SQL DB and Application Insights. You can download this example from https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice.

```TypeScript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
import { signedBlobReadUrl } from "./sas";

// use first 10 characters of the stackname as prefix for resource names
const prefix = pulumi.getStack().substring(0, 9);

const resourceGroup = new azure.core.ResourceGroup(`${prefix}-rg`, {
        location: "West US 2",
    });

const resourceGroupArgs = {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    location: resourceGroup.location,
};

// Storage Account name must be lowercase and cannot have any dash characters
const storageAccountName = `${prefix.toLowerCase().replace(/-/g, "")}sa`;
const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account(storageAccountName, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    accountKind: "StorageV2",
    accountTier: "Standard",
    accountReplicationType: "LRS",
});


const appServicePlan = new azure.appservice.Plan(`${prefix}-asp`, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    kind: "App",

    sku: {
        tier: "Basic",
        size: "B1",
    },
});

const storageContainer = new azure.storage.Container(`${prefix}-c`, {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
    containerAccessType: "private",
});

const blob = new azure.storage.ZipBlob(`${prefix}-b`, {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
    storageContainerName: storageContainer.name,
    type: "block",

    content: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive("wwwroot")
});

const codeBlobUrl = signedBlobReadUrl(blob, storageAccount, storageContainer);

const appInsights = new azure.appinsights.Insights(`${prefix}-ai`, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    applicationType: "Web"
});

const username = "pulumi";

// Get the password to use for SQL from config.
const config = new pulumi.Config();
const pwd = config.require("sqlPassword");

const sqlServer = new azure.sql.SqlServer(`${prefix}-sql`, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    administratorLogin: username,
    administratorLoginPassword: pwd,
    version: "12.0",
});

const database = new azure.sql.Database(`${prefix}-db`, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,
    serverName: sqlServer.name,
    requestedServiceObjectiveName: "S0"
});

const app = new azure.appservice.AppService(`${prefix}-as`, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id,


    appSettings: {
        "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_ZIP": codeBlobUrl,
        "ApplicationInsights:InstrumentationKey": appInsights.instrumentationKey,
        "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY": appInsights.instrumentationKey
    },

    connectionStrings: [{
        name: "db",
        value:
            pulumi.all([sqlServer.name, database.name]).apply(([server, db]) =>
                `Server=tcp:${server}.database.windows.net;initial catalog=${db};user ID=${username};password=${pwd};Min Pool Size=0;Max Pool Size=30;Persist Security Info=true;`),
        type: "SQLAzure"
    }]
});

exports.endpoint = pulumi.interpolate `https://${app.defaultSiteHostname}`;
```

## FAQs

### What is Pulumi?

Pulumi enables developers to write code in their favorite language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Go), deploying cloud apps and infrastructure easily, without the need to learn specialized DSLs or YAML templating solutions.

The use of first class languages enables abstractions and reuse, in addition to software engineering practices like great IDEs, refactoring, and testing. Pulumi provides high-level cloud packages in addition to low-level resource definitions across all the major clouds -- AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes -- so that you can master one system to deliver to them all.

### I have an app that I need to deploy to Azure, and GCP. Can I still use Pulumi?

Yes! Pulumi enables you to achieve continuous delivery of cloud apps and infrastructure to any cloud environment -- AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and even hybrid and on-premises envioronments.

### Is this extension open-source?

Yes. The source code for this extension is at https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-az-pipelines-task.

The Pulumi platform is open-source as well. Visit our GitHub repo at https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi.

### I installed the Pulumi task extension to my organization, but I still cannot find it.

Try to uninstall the extension, and then re-install it. Most of the times this resolves the issue with discovery. If you are still experiencing issues, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-az-pipelines-task/issues).
